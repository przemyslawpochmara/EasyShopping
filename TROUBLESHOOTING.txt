App Not Downloading? Fix It Here!
========================================

PROBLEM: Missing Icons
-----------------------
The app needs icon files to install properly.

FIX:
1. Open "create-icons.html" in your browser
2. Right-click each image and save as:
   - icon-192.png
   - icon-512.png
3. Put these files in the same folder as index.html
4. Re-upload ALL files to Netlify/GitHub


QUICK CHECK:
------------
Make sure you uploaded these 7 files:
✓ index.html
✓ app.js
✓ style.css
✓ manifest.json
✓ sw.js
✓ icon-192.png
✓ icon-512.png


TESTING:
--------
1. Open the link on your phone
2. You should see the shopping list app
3. If it works, try installing:
   - iPhone: Share button → "Add to Home Screen"
   - Android: Menu (3 dots) → "Install app"


STILL NOT WORKING?
------------------
The app will still work in your browser even without installing!
Just bookmark the page and use it from there.

Or try these alternatives:
- Use it directly in browser (no install needed)
- Try a different browser (Chrome works best)
- Make sure the site is HTTPS (Netlify does this automatically)
